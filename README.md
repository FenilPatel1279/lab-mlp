Heyy my naem is fenil patel student id is 9001279 

in this repo i have done is that I loaded the student dataset into a DataFrame, reshaped it using melt and pivot_table to tidy the format, cleaned and standardized week-number columns, filled missing values with mean, median, or mode, and detected and removed outliers through Z-score and IQR filtering using pandas and NumPy functions in a Jupyter Notebook.
